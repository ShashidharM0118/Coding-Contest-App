<b>Problem:</b> <span foreground='blue'>Maximize the Sum</span>

<b>Description:</b>
You are given an array of integers, represented by n elements. Your task is to maximize the sum of these integers by changing the sign 
of at most two numbers. Each integer in the array can be either positive or negative.

<b>Input:</b>
The input consists of two lines:
1. The first line contains a single integer n (10^-5 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), representing the number of elements in the array.
2. The second line contains n integers separated by space, representing the elements of the array. Each integer is between -10^9 and 10^9.

<b>Output:</b>
Output a single integer, the maximum possible sum of the array after changing the sign of at most two numbers.

<b>Sample Input:</b>
5
-2 7 -3 1 -8


<b>Sample Output:</b>
21
